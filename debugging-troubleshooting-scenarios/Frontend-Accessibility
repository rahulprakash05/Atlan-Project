Q. **Frontend Accessibility**:
    - Issue: The frontend service is not accessible externally post-deployment.
    - Task: Diagnose the networking and Ingress configuration, ensuring the frontend is reachable and performs as expected.

- Frontend accessibility issues arises due to networking and misconfiguration in ingress

Steps to follow to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check Frontend Service Status

    kubectl get svc -n <namespace>  #To ensure the service type using eithher loadbalancer (if exposed externally) or clusterIP (if using ingress controller)

2. Verify the Ingress Resource: Check the Ingress resource for the frontend by running

    kubectl get ingress -n <namespace>  #Confirm that the host, paths, and service backend are correctly defined


3. Inspect Ingress Controller Logs: 

    kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx

- Look for any errors related to the routing or backend connection issues.

4. Check DNS Configuration: 
    - Ensure domain (example.com) resolves to the correct external IP of the LoadBalancer (if using an external LoadBalancer service).

    kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx  #Check the external IP status, and verify it's exposed and reachable.


5. Loadbalancer issue: If using a LoadBalancer service type, ensure the load balancer is correctly provisioned and properly linked.

    kubectl describe svc frontend-service -n <namespace>  #Check the external IP status and verify it's exposed and reachable.

6. Check Firewall Rules (Security Groups)
    - Ensure that the necessary firewall rules or security groups allow external traffic on ports 80/443.


7.  Test Connectivity: Test the connection to the frontend service internally using

    curl <frontend-service-cluster-ip>:<port>  #If itâ€™s reachable internally the issue is likely at the ingress or external access level.

8. Cross-Check Network Policies: Ensure there are no Network Policies restricting traffic between the frontend service, ingress, or external users

    kubectl get networkpolicy -n <namespace>


- Following these steps we can identify the accessibility issues and troubleshoot it accordingly
